                <p><span class="text-header">You complete me.</span> You are my everything. You perfectly complement my work and you are always there when you need me. Here are some memories of what you can do for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="text-header">Remember when</span>
                    I forgot where I was in the directory and all I had to do was type
                    <span class="tooltip">pwd<span class="tooltiptext">present working directory</span></span>
                    ? What a good time and perfect representation of how you help me every single day. I love you. You even show me what items are in my current directory by typing <span class="tooltip">ls<span class="tooltiptext">lists contents of a directory</span></span>
                    . You are too easy and too good to me. But above all of that, your ability to help me jump around and move quick is astounding.
                    <span class="tooltip">cd<span class="tooltiptext">changes directory</span></span>
                    and
                    <span class="tooltip">cd /<span class="tooltiptext">changes directory back to root</span></span>
                    are amazing for travering your slim profile and easily moving around directories without using my mouse. I can spend more time talking to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="text-header">But really,</span>
                    your ability to make and delete folders is a great power to have. I love that you let me sahre it with you.
                    <span class="tooltip">mkdir<span class="tooltiptext">makes a new folder</span></span>
                    is so easy to make a new folder and if I accidentally made the wrong folder all I have to do is type in
                    <span class="tooltip">rm<span class="tooltiptext">permanently deletes. use with caution</span></span>
                    . I know this awkward to bring up, but Im sorry that I accidentally deleted the entire OS. I hope when I reload you and you read this that you will be forgiving. I will make sure to
                    <span class="tooltip">touch<span class="tooltiptext">makes a new file</span></span>
                    and edit an entire html file using
                    <span class="tooltip">nano<span class="tooltiptext">edits an existing file using vim</span></span>
                    so you can spend the entire time with me.</p>
